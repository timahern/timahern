      "By Clemente Lisi – NEW YORK, NY (Jun 6, 2022) US Soccer Players – It was 20 years ago that the USMNT stunned the world and reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The 2002 Korea/Japan edition of the tournament was a turning point for the team and soccer as a whole in this country. It showed the world that, for the first time in the modern era, the USMNT could compete at a very high level. It also showed that soccer was continuing to grow a bigger audience after the country’s embrace of the 1999 US Women’s World Cup squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-NASL years of the mid-1980s and early ’90s seemed like an ongoing debate about how soccer couldn’t make it in America. The sometimes-heated conversations of the time included silly talking points about how the game was “too ethnic” and “too slow.” There wasn’t enough scoring and that the American public was just too entrenched in watching the major North American sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 1990 the USA was playing at the World Cup and hosted the next one. MLS launched in 1996. Over the next six years leading up to the 2002 World Cup, the game grew as the USMNT and MLS helped to give the sport more exposure alongside the WNT hosting the 1999 World Cup . Anyone under the age of 35 has no idea just how obscure and niche soccer used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point this century, those anti-soccer arguments seemed to disappear. The internet’s ability to connect Americans to the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League certainly helped as top-class soccer became part of their sports diets. At the same time, the growth of MLS to more markets and the USMNT’s success both regionally and at the World Cup helped a new generation embrace soccer more than older ones ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "While soccer, like other sports, uses statistics to assess who’s up or down, we can use metrics to gauge where soccer is in this country. More importantly, it can be a measure of how far it has come.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1994, for example, this country still seemed skeptical about soccer. A Harris poll conducted on the eve of USA ’94 found that only 20% of the American public knew the World Cup was happening in the United States. As The New York Times put it at the time, “The rest of the world, on the other hand, can be found on the couch with a remote control device in hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are we now? A series of new surveys tried to assess where soccer is in this country 28 years later. A Morning Consult poll, conducted in April, shows that soccer has grown. The highlights: 32% of US adults said they consider themselves soccer fans, including 7% who said they are “avid fans.” In terms of demographics, the survey found that 54% of respondents were interested in soccer, a greater share than any of the big four North American sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unlike other sports, in which the top North American leagues essentially have monopolies on top-level competition, soccer fans’ interest in the sport is spread among MLS, Liga MX and several major European leagues, as well as international competition,” the poll found. “While MLS has grown in-person attendance to more than 20,000 per game and expanded to 29 markets, its TV viewership has suffered in part due to competition with other leagues.”\n",

      "When the poll asked about viewing plans in March, before the USMNT qualified for Qatar, 34% of sports fans, 49% of avid fans, and 21% of the general population expressed interest in watching the World Cup. Eight weeks later, once the US qualified and the poll asked the question again, the numbers grew: 63% of avid fans, 46% of sports fans and 30% of the general public said they’d watch the World Cup.\n",
